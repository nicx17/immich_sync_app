and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- AppImage distribution! A new fully packaged AppImage version of `immich-sync` is now available, bundling `PySide6` and all Python dependencies into a single, highly portable executable.
- Introduced `AI_CONTEXT.md` to help agentic tools understand the application's unique multi-threaded API architecture, system constraints, and X11/Wayland workarounds.

### Fixed

- Fixed critical Qt 6 Wayland connection error where the DBus portal rejected window launching (`Could not register app ID`). Application metadata is now strictly set before Qt engine initialization.
- Fixed a metadata warning regarding the `.desktop` suffix in Qt's `setDesktopFileName` handler.
- Fixed buggy AppRun bash script backslash escaping that was causing `Exec format error` exceptions inside generated `AppImage` distributions.
- Fixed a bug where native AppImages were trying to execute `main.py` outside of isolated module logic.

### Changed

- Promoted project status from Alpha to Beta (`v0.2.0-beta`).
- Added robust direct-file editing scripts to fully automate AppImage extraction, generation, and packaging (`build_test_appimage.sh`).
- Updated PySide6 dependencies and application system documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`).

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Created `AppImage` deployment script and comprehensive guide for easy Linux distribution natively bundling `PySide6` and python libraries.
- Extended testing suite to cover `notifications`, `tray_icon`, and `state_manager` using fully mocked implementations.
- Implemented desktop entry integration and `install.sh` enhancements standardizing icons to `/usr/share/pixmaps`.
- Added new AppImage-specific helper scripts (`install-appimage.sh` and `uninstall-appimage.sh`).
- Added User Guide (`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`), Testing Guide (`docs/TESTING.md`), and Architecture Guide (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) to assist end-users and developers.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and initial project scaffolding.
- Added modern structural badges and active Alpha-phase developmental warnings to the `README.md`.
- Properly credited application icon to Unsplash's Round Icons.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue on GNOME/X11 where the application icon would not render in the dock or settings window due to misaligned `.desktop` metadata (`StartupWMClass`).
- Revised the `install.sh` routine to ensure Python virtual environment integrity and `pip` availability before attempting dependency installation.

### Changed

- Transitioned project license from MIT to **GPL-3.0**.
- Refactored PySide6 window initializations to fallback to a reliable absolute image path as opposed to breaking natively on XDG theme engines lacking caching.
- Updated `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` metadata for publishing (PyPI readiness), adding GPLv3 and Alpha classifiers.
